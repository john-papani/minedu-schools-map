This project brings together information about **all schools in Greece** on one easy-to-explore map. It leverages open datasets provided by the Greek Ministry of Education ([data.gov.gr - minedu\_schools](https://data.gov.gr/datasets/minedu_schools)) to display school locations, types, and contact details.


**Note:** This is an independent, non-official project aimed at making public educational data more accessible and user-friendly.
